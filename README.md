Allows you to place infinite entities from one toy ball in F/AR. This is a bug brought back from the 9.0.0.4/9.0.0.3 versions of the mod!

Note: I do NOT suggest adding this to a server as it can be easily abused to fill the server with entities and make it lag.

Credits:
Some parts of the build.gradle(s) were copied from the F/A ones! I did this in order to solve some dependency and mapping issues.
The use and m_7203_ methods are about the same as they are in F/A, I just removed the part of the methods that decremented the toy ball item stack!
